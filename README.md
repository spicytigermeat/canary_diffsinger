To begin, ensure you have a DiffSinger compatible version of [OpenUTAU](https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau) installed.

Download `CANARY_DS_{version}_PACK.zip` from the latest release on this page. Unzip the pack, and you'll see two folders; One containing a `.zip` with the voicebank, and one containing OpenUTAU plugins.

Drag the voice library `.zip` into OpenUTAU and click accept. Drag any `.dll` files from the OpenUTAU plugins into OpenUTAU and accept. You may then restart OpenUTAU and properly utilize Canary!
